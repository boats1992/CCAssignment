For only one man with blue eyes, he could see no one else with blue eyes and leave with 1 night.

For two men with blue eyes, the find all other people not with blue eyes, they wait for one night to see
if the other is the only one with blue eyes, and after that, they could leave on 2nd night.

For more than two men with blue eyes, they count the number of blue-eyed man and wait for the same number
of nights, and decide wether to leave or not.

So for n men, it takes n nights.
