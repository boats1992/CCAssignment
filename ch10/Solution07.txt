1. With 1GB memory, we can directly use a bitmap to store the
	exsisting values, and scan the bitmap from the very beginning
	to find the first missing element.

2. With only 10MB memory, we need two passes to locate the answer.
	In the first pass, we divide the numbers into several ranges. For
	each range, we count the times that the array falls into that range,
	if it does not meet the total number of the range, it means that
	the missing element is in this range. After that, in the second
	pass, we check all the numbers in that range to find the missing one.
