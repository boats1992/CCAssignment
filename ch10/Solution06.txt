For this question, the problem is that 20GB data could not fit the memory.
So we need to separately sort the file by chunks, say, if there are 4GB memory,
	 we can divide the file into 5 chunks, each chunk can be sorted.
After that, we try to merge the chunks one by one.


In fact, this is the typical example for using MapReduce...
